# E-Commerce Data Visualization

## Objectives and Goals
The goal of this project is to analyze various metrics (profit/loss, advertising effectiveness, return rate costs) for a failing nation-wide store, to help it increase operational
effectiveness and avoid bankruptcy. The purpose was to train the user to Tableau data visualization and further skill in business metric analysis.

## Overview
Various worksheets were assembled in Tableau and put into rudimentary story format. Different dimensions were tested and compared along profit/loss metrics; product sub-category
and geographic region were identified as the most illustrative dimensions, with accompanying bar chart. A bar chart of the ten highest loss products was generated, as well as another 
chart of overall profit/loss across sub-categories. 

A line chart was created to identify states and months with the highest profit, as an identification for where advertising was most effective, and a recommended return on ad spend 
ratio was calculated for those data points.

The returns table was joined to the orders table, and a calculated field was created to identify a returned binary. A return rate calculated was created, which was then used in both
the highest return rate items and highest return rate customers bar charts. Finally, a scatterplot showing the average profit of the most profitable items (by their return rates) 
completes the story.

## Conclusions
The two biggest profit centers are copiers sold in the West region and chairs sold in the East region; the two biggest lost centers are binders in the central region and tables in the
East. Copiers, phones and accesories are the most profitable sub-categories overall, with supplies, bookcases and tables being the least profitable overall. Washington in March, Indiana 
in October, and Vermont in November were identified as the most profitable state/month combinations for advertising campaigns. The most profitable products are not in jeapordy of
being affected by steep return rates. 

## Recommendations
The store should potentially look into discontinuing its supplies, bookcases, and tables product lines. Top ten specific products should be disconinued as well (regardless of 
sub-category). Recommended ROAS advertising spending should be implemented in the effective state/month combinations identified above. Product lines with the 100% return rates must
be discontinued; those with high (sub 100%) return rates should be further analyzed for underlying causes and potentially discontinued. Customers with the highest return rates should
be surveyed and intervied to determine underlying reason for returns, and implement solutions based on these findings.
