# Tableau Story: Customer Segment Analysis

## Goals and Objectives:
The goal of this project was to take data from five different tables, identify key customer segments, and analyze their purchase behavior for a restaurant aggregator/food delivery
app. The purpose was to test my synthesis of all of the different sprint lessons throughout the program in one final project, with minimal outside guidance. 

## Overview 
Out of all data tables, "users", "orders", and "restaurants" were chosen for customer segment analysis. All three tables were cleaned; any fields that would be used in join relations 
were formatted to be compatible. All three tables were joined, with "orders" being the link between the two. Necessary calculated fields were prepared. Various charts were experimented 
with in tableau, the following being chosen for the final dashboard:
1. A bar chart to demonstrate total sales by my primary customer segment categories: gender, marital status, occupation and income.
2. A tree map showing total sales proportions by education level and income level.
3. A line chart showing total sales by age, broken down by occupation.
4. A line chart showing total sales by family size and marital status.
5. A bar chart showing order count by average item cost.
6. A line chart showing total sales throughout the week.
7. A distribution of sales by restaurant cost.

The dashboard was constructed with dynamic filters allowing every chart to be filtered by every user data field. Finally, a story with analysis and recommendations was created, 
with a presentation to walk the viewer through the entire analysis.

## Conclusions
The primary customer segment is male (secondarily female), single, a student, with no monthly income. The primary user is also between the ages of 22-24, in either graudate or
undergraduate studies, and has a small family size. A smaller, secondary segment that drives sales are older, married, employed users- but college students drive the majority of sales
on the app. Users tend to prefer cheaper items and cheaper resturants- a reliance on convenience and low cost which is typical of student behavior. Weekly sales patterns reflect
student life; small family size and no income suggests that students are recipients of parental financial help, and potentially scholarship or grant money; singles cannot rely on a 
spouse to cook while they devote time to studies.

## Recommendations
The company should recognize that its primary demographic is single college students with no income, and make efforts to ensure customer retention by offering referral bonuses and 
intermittent student discounts. The bulk of the marketing strategy should focus on expanding sales among other segments; this can be done by offering user rewards tiers, family
discounts, and other enticements to demographics who are used to more traditional culinary patterns. The company should collect feedback and surveys from users, as well as social
media sentiment, go gain greater understanding of user motivations.
