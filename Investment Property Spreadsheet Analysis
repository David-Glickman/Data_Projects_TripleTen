# Investment Property Spreadsheet Analysis

Goals and Objectives: The objective of this project was to determine optimal Manhattan rental properties to invest in, by analyzing Airbnb rental data. Popular neighborhoods
and property sizes were analyzed by volume of reviews, and then listings were ranked by revenue generated within those popular criteria. The purpose of this project was to exercise 
and test my spreadsheet skills.

Overview: First, the raw dataset in Googe Sheets was cleaned and appropriate cleaned columns were entered. A pivot table was then generated to show the top ten neighborhoods by number 
of reviews written. Another pivot table was generated to show the preponderance of rental sizes (bedroom number) within those popular neighborhoods. A binary top_listings column was 
then generated to indicate if a rental property satisfied the criteria (top neighborhood, dominant rental size within that neighborhood); properties that satisfied this criteria were 
then placed in a pivot table and ranked according to annual revenue earned. 

Conclusion: Investors looking for the most profitable rentals should look for 1 bedrooms in the Lower East Side, Hells Kitchen, Harlem, the Upper West Side, Chelsea, the East Village,
East Harlem, the West Village, and the Upper West Side, as well as studio apartments in Midtown. The highest earning property brings an annual revenue of $359,280; the average annual 
earnings of the top listings category is $66,209.

Recommendations: Investors should consult the Top Listings table for specific properties to bid on, and should probably limit their search to 1 bedroom apartments in the Lower East
Side, Harlem, and Hell's Kitchen, and studio apartments in Midtown.
