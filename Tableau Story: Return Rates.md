# Tableau Story: Return Rates 

## Objectives and Goals
The goal of this project was to understand the underlying causes of product returns at a nationwide store, and to find recommendations to help reduce returns. The goal was to
test skills in regards to data visualization, business calculations, and data storytelling/tableau stories.

## Overview
First a "returns" table was left joined to an "orders" table; the returned field was calculated into a boolean value in order to be able to generate a return rate (average of the field).
The following worksheets were built for exploratory analysis of return causes:
1. A scatterplot with trendline showing the correlation between total sales and total returns, with products aggregated by subcategory.
2. A bar chart showing return rate by product category.
3. Table showing return rate by customer.
4. A map showing return rates by states.
5. A line chart showing return rates by month
6. A bar chart showing return rates by region and product sub-category
7. A bar chart showing top returned products, broken down by subcategory.

A dashboard was then constructed displaying all of the graphs, along with dynamic filters for each product category and subcategory. Finally, a tableau story was created with an 
accompanying video presention, to walk the viewer through findings and conclusions.

## Conclusions
Reasons for the company's return rate are complex and multifaceted. The western region leads returns, with a handful of states in other regions coming in second; supply chain
issues or regional management culture are possible culprits. Electronics (machines, phones, appliances) as well as paper/binders are the highest returned sub-catorgies; top five
returned products are printers and phones- manufacturing issues or damage in transit are possible causes. August, September and December see the highest returns, possibly 
correlated with end of year sales or beginning of school year sales. Specific customers return 100% of their orders in one state but not others, again possibly relating to
regional/state level management issues.

## Recommendations
Further analysis and inquiry should be conducted in high return rate states, especially the western region- particularly into management as well as supply chain. Customers with the
highest rate of returns should be surveyed so that stakeholders can understand what drives their behavior. Most returned products should be investigated for potential recalls and 
breakage in shipping; stakeholders should consider removing these products from the stores inventory if necessary. Broad customer base should also be surveyed/analyzed to determine
what causes returns in key months.
